## Course Project Instructions 

### run_analysis.R

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### Installation

You will need to update run_analysis.R to your working directory where the data set is located

Run
```
source('Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project/run_analysis.R')
```
